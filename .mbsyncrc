# IMAP keeps an "internaldate" attribute for messages, which is separate
# from the date given in the message header, set based upon when the
# message was first received.  Fastmail's webmail interface at least
# uses this attribute to properly order messages chronologically.
#   The CopyArrivalDate option isn't well documented but it seems that when
# synchronising a new message it uses the Maildir file's Modify date as the
# IMAP internaldate attribute and vice versa. Otherwise it seemed the
# synchronisation time was being used instead. By setting the option here it's
# enabled by default for all Channels.
CopyArrivalDate yes
